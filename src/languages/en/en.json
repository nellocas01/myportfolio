After having completed an intensive master's degree that enabled me to acquire most of my knowledge, I am now embarking on my first work experience in this field, where I try to improve my current skills, but also develop new ones. I consider myself an excellent worker, as I am also completely available for team-working. I am a perceptive person, even when faced with difficulties I try to overcome them as best I can, if there is a challenge I do not shy away from it."
